We have reserved a call-in number for the tcon at <field "time">.
This is set up to have at most <field "number"> parties calling
in. Here is the information:

<field "tcon parameters">

Just a quick note: when you call in and there is no one on the line,
please do not hang up.  The tcon system here voids the tcon ID and
deletes the tcon session, if all of the people sign off once it is
started.
